                Kaitlyn will be graduating in May 2016 and is looking for full time employment shortly after that.  Her past internship projects have ranged from programming in C/C++ to ASP.NET and C# alongside MySQL and javascript. Past class work has included a web app in ruby on rails and another using CAKEPHP. She also has class experience with Java, javascript, HTML, and MATLAB.
Kaitlyn has had the opportunity to work on the front end and back end of the stack and enjoys both. She has completed a course in javascript and database systems. She has also taken several courses in which she learned Agile and Scrum and put the philosophy work in her projects. 
Kaitlyn is ready to get on a real world team and start coding. Please call or e-mail her if you would like more information or would like to set-up an interview.

              This semester, Kaitlyn is completing her senior design project. She is working in a group of four to create
              an Andriod app that will display CAN-bus messages from a vehicle sent over bluetooth. She is working in another
              group of four to create a website for the University of Iowa running club. For this project she will be utilizing
              Angularjs, Nodejs, MongoDB, the google maps api and several testing frameworks. This project will be done using
              the Agile process, specifically Scrum. She will be using Pivotal Tracker for keeping track of user stories, Heroku
              for deployment, and the Cloud9 IDE.
